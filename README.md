Project 1 Ironhack

Introduction
The goal was to apply some concepts learned in the first 4 weeks of classes into a real dataset. The dataset chosed was e-commerce fraud from Kaggle. 

Objective
My objective was to do an exploratory analysis and understand about fraud customers patterns.

Steps
The case had 2 raw files(customer_df and cust_transactions_details) that were divided into first 2 clean files(dfc2_states and dft) and then the 2 clean files were divided in fraud and non fraud clients based on the emails (dft_filtered, dft_filtered_nf, dfc_filtered,dfc_filtered_nf).
After that plots were made to understand the costumer patterns and separate then into fraud and non fraud customers.

Next steps
An statistical analysis to understand if for example more than one address by customer_email will result in a fraud.
